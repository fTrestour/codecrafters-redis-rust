# Project

This repo is based on the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis) from [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io).

I implemented a thread based version of this project (the challenge also suggests doing an event loop version which I didn't focus on).

# Context

I implemented it as a way to train my Rust skills while learning the language with [the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html).
When writing this I have read the book up to chapter 10.
